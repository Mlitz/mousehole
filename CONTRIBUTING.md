# Contributing to Mousehole

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mousehole!

Here are some things to keep in mind:

- No contribution is too small! Please submit as many fixes for typos and
  grammar bloopers as you can.
- Beginners are welcome. If you are new to programming, Git,
  JavaScript/TypeScript, or anything related to the project, then I can help
  you. Just ask.
- Don't be afraid to open half-finished PRs, and ask questions if something is
  unclear!
